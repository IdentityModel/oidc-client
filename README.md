# oidc-client

OpenID Connect (OIDC) client library

## Install
To install you can either get the oidc-client via npm, bower, via the dist folder in this repo, or you can clone this repo and run gulp yourself.

**NOTE:** In case you need to support IE11 or below, please include es6-promise as a part of your website. This should be loaded before oidc-client to avoid errors. 

As of now, there are not really any docs (sorry), but there are some samples in this repo.
